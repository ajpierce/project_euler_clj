# Project Euler Clojure Solutions
The more Clojure I learn, the more wonderful it seems.
In an effort to become more comfortable with Clojure, I've decided to (slowly;
I'm a new father ðŸ˜ƒ) solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems in
my "spare time."

If you see something I could be doing better, send me a pull request! Being able
to interact with a Clojure mentor would be fantastic.

## Planck
I am using Mike Fikes' excellent [Planck REPL](https://github.com/mfikes/planck)
to run these CLJS scripts.
