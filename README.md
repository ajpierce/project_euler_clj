# Project Euler Clojure Solutions
My solutions (in Clojure) to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems

## Running
If you haven't already, install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

Type `lein repl` to start the REPL in this project's directory.

Then, to see the answer to (for example) problem 030, type (in the REPL):

```
(use 'euler.solutions.030 :reload)
```

## Feedback
If you see something I could be doing better, send me a pull request! Being able
to interact with a Clojure mentor would be fantastic.
